# Introduction

## About this Workshop
This workshop comprising six hands-on labs, introduces you to Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py) on Oracle Autonomous Database. OML4Py supports scalable in-database data exploration and preparation using native Python syntax, invocation of in-database algorithms for model building and scoring, and embedded execution of user-defined Python functions from Python or REST APIs. OML4Py also includes the AutoML interface for automated algorithms and feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning. Join us for this tour of OML4Py.

### Why is this Workshop Needed
Python is a major programming language used for data science and machine learning. OML4Py is a new feature on Autonomous Database that provides Python users access to powerful in-database functionality supporting data scientists for both scalability, performance, and ease of solution deployment. It is essential that Oracle provides adequate training content to introduce users to this technology and support the OML Data Scientist Certification Exam.
### What Products and Technologies are used?
ADB, OML Notebooks, OML4Py

Estimated Lab Time: 120 minutes. This estimate is for the entire workshop - it is the sum of the estimates provided for each of the labs included in the workshop.

### About Product/Technology
Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py) is a component of Oracle Autonomous Database, that includes Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), and Oracle Autonomous JSON Database (AJD). By using Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks, you can run Python functions on data for data exploration and preparation while leveraging Oracle Database as a high-performance computing environment. Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks is available through Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) , Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) and Autonomous JSON Database (AJD) services.
